      <p>
        HeartPrayerMusic creates custom digital songs and musical works based on
        information you provide.
      </p>
      <p>Because music is creative and subjective:</p>
      <br />
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>■ Results may vary.</li>
        <li>■ Emotional reactions are personal and not guaranteed.</li>

          characteristics, commercial success, or satisfaction level.

        <li>
          ■ Services are for creative and entertainment purposes only and do not

      <p>
        We reserve the right to refuse any request that is unlawful, infringing,
        inappropriate, or inconsistent with our brand values.

        3.1 Faith-Based Values and Content Guidelines
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        HeartPrayerMusic is a faith-based creative service rooted in Christian
        beliefs. As such, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to
        refuse, modify, or discontinue any request that would require us to
        create, endorse, or promote content that conflicts with our sincerely
        held religious beliefs, moral convictions, or spiritual mission.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This includes, without limitation, requests that promote or endorse
        themes, messages, or language that we determine to be inconsistent with
        Christian doctrine, biblical values, or the intended spiritual purpose
        of our Services.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Decisions under this section are based on the requested content and
        expressive message, not on the identity, status, or personal
        characteristics of any individual.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If a request is declined for these reasons before production has begun,
        we may, at our discretion, issue a refund. Once production has begun,
        standard cancellation and refund terms apply.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>We do not guarantee that any work will:</p>

        18. Governing Law and Binding Arbitration
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Wyoming, USA.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Federal Arbitration Act governs interpretation and enforcement of
        this arbitration provision.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        All disputes shall be resolved by binding individual arbitration
        administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer
        Arbitration Rules.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>The arbitrator has exclusive authority to determine arbitrability.</p>
      <br />
      <p>You waive:</p>
      <br />
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>■ Jury trial</li>
        <li>■ Class actions</li>
        <li>■ Collective actions</li>
        <li>■ Representative actions</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        If the class action waiver is found unenforceable, this arbitration
        provision is void.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Either party may bring claims in small claims court where permitted.
